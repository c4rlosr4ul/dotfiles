# feh key configuration.
# Comments start with a # sign, do not use them mid-line.
# Each line must be blank, a comment, or a key definition.
#
# key definition: <action name> <key1> [<key2> [<key3>]]
#
# Each <key> is an X11 keysym (as output by xev) with optional modifier.
# For instance, C-x would be Ctrl+X, or 4-space Mod4+Space

# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
menu_parent H Left
menu_child  L Right
menu_down   J Down
menu_up     K Up
menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img L
prev_img H

# and image movement
scroll_up    k
scroll_down  j
scroll_left  l
scroll_right h

# File deletion
remove     D   Delete
delete   C-d C-Delete

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames f

# zooming
zoom_in  s
zoom_out a
zoom_default d
zoom_fit f

# I only hit these accidentally
save_image
save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
